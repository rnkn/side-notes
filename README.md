# Side Notes #

Quickly display your quick side notes in quick side window.

Side notes live in a plain text file, called `notes.txt` by default,
in the current directory or any higher directory in the current
hierarchy. i.e. When locating notes, we first look for a `notes.txt`
file in the current directory, then one directory up, then two
directories up, and so forth.

Side notes are displayed in a side window with the command
`side-notes-toggle-notes`.

The filename is defined by user option `side-notes-file`.

To really mix things up, there's the user option
`side-notes-secondary-file`, which defaults to `notes-2.txt`, and will
display a separate notes file in a lower side window when the command
`side-notes-toggle-notes` is prefixed with an argument (`C-u`).

By default, having a notes file in any parent directory will locate
that file rather than visit a non-existing file in the current
directory, but you can override this by prefixing
`side-notes-toggle-notes` with...

- `C-u C-u` to force visiting `side-notes-file` within the current
  directory.
- `C-u C-u C-u` to force visiting `side-notes-secondary-file` within
  the current directory.

Of course, you can use Markdown or Org Mode formatting by changing the
file extensions of `side-notes-file` and/or
`side-notes-secondary-file`.

displayed, see `(info "(elisp) Side Windows")`
