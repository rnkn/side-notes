Side Notes
==========

[![MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/packages/side-notes-badge.svg)][1]
[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/side-notes-badge.svg)][2]

Quickly display your quick side notes in quick side window.

Side notes live in a plain text file, called `notes.txt` by default, in
the current directory or any parent directory (i.e. when locating notes,
we first look in the current directory, then one directory up, then two
directories up, and so forth.)

Side notes are displayed in a side window with the command
`side-notes-toggle-notes`.

The filename is defined by user option `side-notes-file`.

To really mix things up, there's the user option
`side-notes-secondary-file`, which defaults to `notes-2.txt`, and will
display a separate notes file in a lower side window when the command
`side-notes-toggle-notes` is prefixed with an argument (`C-u`).

By default a notes file found in any parent directory will open that
file rather than visit a non-existing file in the current directory, but
you can override this by prefixing `side-notes-toggle-notes` with...

 - `C-u C-u` to force visiting `side-notes-file` within the current
   directory.
 - `C-u C-u C-u` to force visiting `side-notes-secondary-file` within
   the current directory.

Of course, you can use Markdown or Org Mode or whatever by changing the
file extensions of `side-notes-file` and/or `side-notes-secondary-file`.

For more information on how to change the way the side window is
displayed, see `(info "(elisp) Side Windows")`.
